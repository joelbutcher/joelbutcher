### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joel and I'm a full stack developer.

I create awesome software for the web, such as the hugely popular [Socialstream](https://github.com/joelbutcher/socialstream) open source libarary. I currently work as a Full Stack Developer at [Adzooma](https://adzooma.com).

As a full stack dev, it's important to keep an open mind when new projects come through. I tend to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for most projects, mind.

I tend to use [Laravel](https://laravel.com) for backend systems / API's, because my background is PHP and it's a framework I'm very familiar with. However, I'm starting to investigate GraphQL and developing API's solely in Next.js platforms with a GraphQL database.

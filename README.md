## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joel and I'm a full stack developer. I specialise in Laravel, Next.js, React, Vue and Tailwind. I'm the maintainer of the hugely popular [Socialstream](https://github.com/joelbutcher/socialstream) PHP package for [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com).

I love to create awesome software for the web, if you would like to collaborate with me on any projects or ideas you have, or just to get my take on an implementation, drop me a message via my Twitter handle below.

## What I'm currently working on

### Socialstream
- I've rebuilt the docs website using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) - find it [here](https://docs.socialstream.dev)
- I've created a demo site for Socialstream (with some design changes) â€“ find it [here](https://demo.socialstream.dev)

### Firebase User Upload
This was a fun little project, I was researching how to authenticate users of an existing Laravel application with Google Firebase. As part of this research, I built a little Python script to batch import users from the `users` table of a local Laravel application into a new Firebase project. Find the source code [here](https://github.com/joelbutcher/laravel-firebase-user-importer).
